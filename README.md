<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 RoR FOOD RECIPES <a name="about-project"></a>

RoR FOOD RECIPES is a Ruby on Rails application that keeps track of all your food and recipes. It allows you to create recipes, foods and also generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.
